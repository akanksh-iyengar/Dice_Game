# Dice_Game
This dice game app was made as a part of Google Applied CS with Android

This app is based on the basic rules of rolling a die and observing the outcomes. An arbitrary score of 100 is fixed and the player plays against the CPU.
The rule states that whoever reaches 100 first wins.
Player and the CPU take turns alternatively and each of them is allowed to roll dice as many times as desired. But the catch is that if a 1 is encountered on the face of the die the total score which is added for each roll until this end is lost and score is brought down to 0 and the turn of the CPU/player is switched.
However it is allowed to hold to a particular value after rolling say k times and the turn is then switched retaining the score.
